# stock-predictor
Site can be seen on github pages [here](https://joemiller4500.github.io/stock-predictor/).
The first start of this code was a project done in a group for class in collaboration with [Kelby Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelby-wilson/), [Criselda Dimacali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/criselda-d-b45623105/), and [Nehemiah Dang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehemiah-dang/). At the conclusion of our collaborative effort, we had a Heroku hosted HTML page with predictions for 10 days, as is done here, but it was done without the capability to automatically updated, and thus only gave 10 days from when the site was posted.
                
Since then, I've hosted the project on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com)in order to update the site daily via virtual machine. I completely redesigned the HTML using a basic starter template from [Start Bootstrap LLC](https://startbootstrap.com/). I restructured our python code in order to give comparrisons for all companies, and generally implemented more rigorous data cleaning to account for weekends and edge cases, and to make graphing cleaner. I scrapped the old plots and switched to interactive JavaScript libraries - [D3](https://d3js.org) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com). Python libraries used include [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning, [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data processing. Daily API calls are run using [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) in order to update data.
              
The models for these companies are built using 100 epochs of learning on an LSTM model. Historical data is taken from late 1999 until the present, unless that stock came onto the public market subsequently. Daily predictions are made using the models trained on historical data, and are fed the last 100 most recent opening prices for each company. These 100 data points are used to predict one day into the future, and then the 99 most recent days and the one predicted day are fed to the model again to predict another day into the future. This is repeated until we have a prediction for each market day for 2 weeks.

Because of the nature of the stock market, days further into the future are obviously less likely to be accurate. These 
models know as much as I could teach them, but without the knowledge of a trader and the ability to verify future predictions,
these predictions get less founded. Please use predictions given on this site with caution and thoughtfulness. 

Big thanks to Thushan Ganegadara, whose [article](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/lstm-python-stock-market) on LSTM modeling of the stock market provided the initial training I needed to start this project, with the help of my former group mates. The code in this article provided the backbone of the modeling done for this site. Thank you also to [@larsenmtl](https://bl.ocks.org/larsenmtl) whose [code](https://bl.ocks.org/larsenmtl/e3b8b7c2ca4787f77d78f58d41c3da91) was a great start for the interactive D3 line graphs found on this site.
